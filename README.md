# Grid System

This is a lightweight and responsive grid system created with SASS and Compass.app. Feel free to use it.

If you want to install this grid system only need to pass the style.css file to your path folder and enjoy it.

> Note: Remember that is 100% csutomizable, and if you want to change any width or need to create new classes, you are able to do it. Just need to read the code and create your own classes.

## Usage

The HTML tags or classes are very simple:

* The main class is the `row`, this is set the table and the clear, and inside this you'll put your columns.
* The Grid System is based on 12 columns, and the width of one column is 8.33% of 100%, that means (100 / 12) = 8.33.
* Remeber to feel free for change the width values or columns width.
* There exists two more classes (`container` and `container-full`) and these classes allows you to set **960px** or **Full** width respectly to your page.

```html
  <div class='container-fluid'>
    <div class='row'>
      <div class='col-2'></div>
      <div class='col-2'></div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Thanks.
